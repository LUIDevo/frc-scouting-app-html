# Welcome to Team 6632's Scouting App
This app is designed for almost any device, and it was specifically designed to work with school chromebooks without Wifi.

#### To download, press the green "Code" button, then press download ZIP. After it is finished, extract the ZIP file and open the new folder. After that, press dashboard.html or index.html to start logging!

## This app has been **tested**, but there still might be some problems. To limit them, here are some things to be **careful** of:
- If you put the same match number as a previous log, it will **overwrite the log.** This means that you cant have 2 teams being scouted at the same time on one laptop. One laptop per robot at a time.
- Be cautious with your comments. Try not to add slashes or backslashes or anything of that sort that could potentially break the app.
- Almost all data is saved in checkpoints, but some data will be erased if you close or refresh the tab mid game (eg. counters get reset on match.html).

## > Make sure you download the app before the trip, as there wont be wifi there.

Additional notes: 
If you are scouting a practice match, put practice followed by any number in index.html for the match number input. Just be sure that you didnt use this number before in practice, or it will overwrite the previous log!
